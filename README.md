Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is one of the popular case studies in the data science community.You must have heard or invested in any cryptocurrency once in your life. It is a digital medium of exchange that is encrypted and decentralized. Many people use cryptocurrencies as a form of investing because it gives great returns even in a short period. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin are among the popular cryptocurrencies today.  I will be performing the task of cryptocurrency price prediction with machine learning using Python.

Using machine learning for cryptocurrency price prediction can only work in situations where prices change due to historical prices that people see before buying and selling their cryptocurrency. So, I will be predicting the bitcoin prices (which is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies) for the next 30 days.

For this task, I will collect the latest Bitcoin prices data from Yahoo Finance, using the yfinance API.Yahoo Finance is one of the most popular websites to collect stock price data. yfinance is an API provided by Yahoo Finance to collect the latest stock price data.

 I have used the AutoTS library (Automatic Time Series) to predict the bitcoin prices for the next 30 days, it is an automatic machine learning library in Python which is developed for the task of automatic time series forecasting. We can use this library for any task of time series forecasting such as predicting the stock prices for the next n number of days.
